Web Application Title

MALAYSIAN SUGAR CRAVING ASSESSMENT TOOL (MySCAT)

Introduction

MySCAT is a web-based application developed for assessing sugar craving levels among users. The system allows users to register, log in, complete assessments, and view results. Initially, the application focused on functionality but lacked robust security controls. This project enhances the existing web application by implementing essential web security mechanisms to protect user data and prevent common web attacks.

Objectives of Security Enhancements

To protect sensitive user and health-related data

To prevent unauthorized access to system features

To mitigate common web vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection

To apply industry best practices in web application security
